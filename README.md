# Official Salvatore Pisciotta's pyls repo

This repository provides a python implementation of the ```ls``` command, that is a command to list directories file in systems from terminal.
This functionality is adapted to work with directory structures metadata provided via JSON input, simulating the behavior of ```ls```.
